# GMIT Programming for Data Analysis Assignment 2019

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with detailed explanation of use numpy.random package what was assigned as completion for Programming for Data Analysis in second semester of 2019.

[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/brianmcginley/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf)

## The main goal and the key points

Using the Jupyter notebook explain the use of the **numpy.random** package with main focus on following tasks:

* Explain the overall purpose of the package
* Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions
* Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions
* Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers

## How to run code the in Jupyter Notebook

There are couple of ways to view and run notebook.

   1. The file can be downloaded locally and run on the PC with Jupyter Notebook installed
   2. It can be viewed in the web browser on the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
   3. Directrly on the GitHub

### How to install Jupyter Notebook

The most convinient way to quickly install Jupyter Notebook is use of Anaconda package.  
Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

Download Anaconda. We recommend downloading Anaconda’s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.7).
Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

To run the notebook type in the cmd or commander:
